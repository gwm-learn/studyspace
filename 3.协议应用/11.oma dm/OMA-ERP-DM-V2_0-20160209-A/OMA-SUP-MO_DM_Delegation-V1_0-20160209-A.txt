If a Management Authority has a Delegate access right, then the Management Authority SHOULD be able to change the access rights for the sub-tree addressed by the &lt;MOID&gt;/&lt;MIID&gt;/&lt;x&gt;/Path node unless the permissions are overwritten at the descendent node.
Even if the Management Authority (the delegating MA) has the Delegate access rights, the DM Client MUST reject the delegation request if the delegated Management Authority does not provide the MOID of the MO instance during the bootstrap.
The value of this node is a summary of the access rights value in this table:
