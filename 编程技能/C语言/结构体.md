# 初始化
## 定义
```C
struct Member {
    int first;
    double second;
    char *third;
    float four;
}
```

## 赋值
### 定义时赋值
```C
struct Member test = {10, 3.269325, "test", 0.25};
```

### 定义后逐个赋值
```C
struct Member test;

test.first = 10;
test.second = 3.269325;
test.third = "test";
test.four = 0.25;
```

### 定义时乱序赋值C
```C
struct Member test = {
    .second = 3.26325,
    .four = 0.25,
    .first = 10,
    .third = "test"
};
```

### 定义时乱序赋值C++
```C++
struct Member test = {
    second: 3.26325,
    four: 0.25,
    first: 10,
    third: "test"
}
```
